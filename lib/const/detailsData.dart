String autism =
    "<p>Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 36 children in the United States today.</p><p>We know that there is not one autism but many subtypes, most influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. The ways in which people with autism learn, think and problem-solve can range from highly skilled to severely challenged. Some people with ASD may require significant support in their daily lives, while others may need less support and, in some cases, live entirely independently.</p><p>Several factors may influence the development of autism, and it is often accompanied by sensory sensitivities and medical issues such as gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, seizures or sleep disorders, as well as mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression and attention issues.</p><p>Signs of autism usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays can appear even earlier, and often, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. Research shows that early intervention leads to positive outcomes later in life for people with autism.</p>";

String soa =
    "<p>One of the most important things you can do as a parent or caregiver is to learn the early signs of autism and become familiar with the typical developmental milestones that your child should be reaching.</p><h2>What are the signs of autism?</h2><p>The autism diagnosis age and intensity of autism’s early signs vary widely. Some infants show hints in their first months. In others, behaviors become obvious as late as age 2 or 3.</p><p>Not all children with autism show all the signs. Many children who <em>don’t</em> have autism show a few. <strong>That’s why professional evaluation is crucial.</strong></p><p>The following may indicate your child is at risk for an autism spectrum disorder. If your child exhibits any of the following, ask your pediatrician or family doctor for an evaluation right away:</p><h3>By 6 months</h3><ul><li>Few or no big smiles or other warm, joyful and engaging expressions</li><li>Limited or no eye contact</li></ul><h3>By 9 months</h3><ul><li>Little or no back-and-forth sharing of sounds, smiles or other facial expressions</li></ul><h3>By 12 months</h3><ul><li>Little or no babbling</li><li>Little or no back-and-forth gestures such as pointing, showing, reaching or waving</li><li>Little or no response to name</li></ul><h3>By 16 months</h3><ul><li>Very few or no words</li></ul><h3>By 24 months</h3><ul><li>Very few or no meaningful, two-word phrases (not including imitating or repeating)</li></ul><h3>At any age</h3><ul><li>Loss of previously acquired speech, babbling or social skills</li><li>Avoidance of eye contact</li><li>Persistent preference for solitude</li><li>Difficulty understanding other people’s feelings</li><li>Delayed language development</li><li>Persistent repetition of words or phrases (echolalia)</li><li>Resistance to minor changes in routine or surroundings</li><li>Restricted interests</li><li>Repetitive behaviors (flapping, rocking, spinning, etc.)</li><li>Unusual and intense reactions to sounds, smells, tastes, textures, lights and/or colors</li></ul>";

String treat = '''
<p>Even if your child hasn’t officially been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, they may still benefit from certain treatments. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) makes those treatments possible for children under age 3 who may be at risk for developmental problems.</p>
<p>
The type of treatment your child receives for autism spectrum disorder depends on their individual needs. Because ASD is a spectrum disorder (meaning some children have mild symptoms and others have severe symptoms) and each child who has it is unique, there are a variety of treatments.</p>

<p>They can include different kinds of therapies to improve speech and behavior, and sometimes medications to help manage any medical conditions related to autism.

The treatments your child can benefit from most depends on their situation and needs, but the goal is the same: to reduce their symptoms and improve their learning and development.</p>

<p><h4>Behavior and Communication Treatments</h4></p>

<p><em>Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).</em> ABA is often used in schools and clinics to help your child learn positive behaviors and reduce negative ones. This approach can be used to improve a wide range of skills, and there are different types for different situations, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Discrete trial training (DTT)</strong> uses simple lessons and positive reinforcement.</li>
  <li><strong>Pivotal response training (PRT)</strong> helps develop motivation to learn and communicate.</li>
  <li><strong>Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)</strong> is best for children under age 5.</li>
  <li><strong>Verbal behavior intervention (VBI)</strong> focuses on language skills.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developmental, Individual Differences, Relationship-Based Approach (DIR).</em> This kind of treatment is better known as Floortime. That’s because it involves you getting on the floor with your child to play and do the activities they like.</p>

<p>It’s meant to support emotional and intellectual growth by helping them learn skills around communication and emotions.</p>

<p><em>Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication-handicapped Children (TEACCH).</em> This treatment uses visual cues such as picture cards to help your child learn everyday skills like getting dressed. Information is broken down into small steps so they can learn it more easily.</p>

<p><em>The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).</em> This is another visual-based treatment, but it uses symbols instead of picture cards. Your child learns to ask questions and communicate through special symbols.</p>


<p><em>Occupational Therapy.</em></p> This kind of treatment helps your child learn life skills like feeding and dressing themselves, bathing, and understanding how to relate to other people. The skills they learn are meant to help them live as independently as they can.

<p><em>Sensory Integration Therapy.</em></p> If your child is easily upset by things like bright lights, certain sounds, or the feeling of being touched, this therapy can help them learn to deal with that kind of sensory information.


<p><h4>Medications</h4></p>

<p>There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, and there’s currently no medication to treat it. But some medicines can help with related symptoms like depression, seizures, insomnia, and trouble focusing.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that medication is most effective when it’s combined with behavioral therapies.</p>

<p><em>Risperidone (Risperdal)</em> and <em>Aripiprazole (Abilify)</em> are the only drugs approved by the FDA for children with autism spectrum disorder. Risperidone can be prescribed for children between 5 and 16 years old to help with irritability and aggression. Aripiprazole can be prescribed for children between 6 and 17 years old.</p>

<p>Some doctors will prescribe other drugs in certain cases, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anti-anxiety medications, or stimulants, but they’re not FDA-approved for autism spectrum disorder.</p>

<p>Talk with your child’s doctor about whether there are medicines that treat their symptoms.</p>

<p><h4>Nutrition</h4></p>

<p>Experts don’t recommend any specific diets for children with autism spectrum disorder, but getting proper nutrition is important. Sometimes kids with ASD restrict their food or parents try eliminating things like gluten to see if it helps symptoms improve.</p>

<p>However, there is no research that has proven that removing gluten or casein (proteins in wheat and milk products) from their diet is a helpful treatment for ASD, and limiting foods like dairy can prevent proper bone development.</p>

<p>Kids with autism spectrum disorder tend to have thinner bones than kids without it, so bone-building foods are important. You might want to work with a nutritionist or registered dietitian to develop a healthy eating plan.</p>
